# Monte Carlo Simulator
A Monte Carlo Simulation with three classes: die, game, and analyzer. In addition, there are unit tests, a scenario script, and documentation for the code. Created for DS5100 as a final project.

# Synopsis
## Installing and Importing
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Go into your terminal and change the working directory to the root of this directory.
3. From the terminal, execute the following code:
            pip install -e .
4. If everything is successful, you should see:
            Successfully installed Monte-Carlo-Simulation-1.0.0
Congratulations! Now, you're ready to use all this package has to offer.

To import the three classes into your project, go to your python file and at the top, type in:
            from montecarlo import Die, Game, Analyzer
            
This allows you to type in the methods without specifying the package (as the example code will demonstrate). This is the recommended way, but alternatively, you can simply import the package as so:
            import montecarlo
But using this will require specifying the montecarlo package whenever a method is needed to be called.

# Creating dice
